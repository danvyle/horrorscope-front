## HORRORSCOPES

The app can be found here: https://horrorscopes-front.herokuapp.com/

## Motivation 

Do you ever feel crazy and wonder if there's something else to blame? Is Mercury in retrograde? Is there a full moon? Let me check my horoscope today... the motivation here was for a quick reference guide to anything that could explain away your or the universe's odd behavior. 

## About this project

This is a horoscope app, aptly named Horrorscopes. It's a quick-reference guide for astrological signs to find an excuse for what could be wrong with them, whether it be an ominous daily horoscope, planets in retrograde or a full moon. 

*Please note that Capricorn's horoscope is rigged to show the opposite of full moon and planets in retrograde. The month of January has almost zero planets in retrograde so Capricorn may be the only normal sign if you view the site within the next week. (ALSO: Please forgive any slow lag times as it is hosted on a free heroku account)
